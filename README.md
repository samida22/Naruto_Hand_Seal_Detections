# Naruto_Hand_Seal_Detections
One of my favourite ( お気に入り Okiniiri) .Trying hard to do something with it.
# It has been my dream to do this project since long time.
## So I grab my all energy sit on chair with big mug of coffee, hand within keyboard I searched alot and decide to go with VGG16 I move on but cannot go forward. That sucked but Akiramenaide I started everything from scratch 

### firstly I preprocess data give it the size og 224 by 224 and did some stuff like usual that should be done while developing Neural Network 
### move on for more compilations and hyperparemeter tuning, checkpointing, early stopping but I get to nowhere and then I realized it's definately of low data source here I am stopping this for some time I will get back with ddata augmentation
and more scrappingof data from web and will try something different and kakoii styles.
#some glimpse of my experience with networks:
